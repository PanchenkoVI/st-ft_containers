# st-ft_containers (2021/06/27)
## TASK
- Implement the following containers and turn in the necessary files <container>.hpp.
- You must also provide a main.cpp which tests everything for your evaluations.
- You must produce one binary with only your containers and one with the same testing with STL containers.
- Member functions, Non-member and overloads are expected.
- Respect the naming, take care to details.
- You must justify your inner data structure for each container (using a simple array
for a map is not ok).
- If the container has an iterator system, you must implement it.
- You cannot implement more public functions than the ones offered in the standard containers. Everything else must be private or protected. Each public function/- variable must be justified.
- For non-member overloads, the keyword friend is allowed. Each use of friend must be justified and will be checked during evaluation.

  You must turn in the following containers and their associated functions:
- Vector
- List
- Map
- Queue
- Stack

  - Your stack will use your vector class as default underlaying container, it must still be compatible with others containers like the STL one.
- STL containers are forbidden.
- You are allowed to use the STD library.
